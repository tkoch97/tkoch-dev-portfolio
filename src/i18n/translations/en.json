    "aboutData_myStartText": "My journey into technology began in childhood, exploring the typical PCs of the 2000s. When I was a teenager, I started creating custom content for The Sims game using Photoshop, which led me to graphic design. In 2021, a friend introduced me to web development, especially front-end development, which sparked my interest in the area. I started studying HTML and CSS, then decided to delve deeper into the area. I entered higher education and also started studying web development at Rocketseat (a Brazilian programming course), where I also learned about back-end development and immersed myself in the tech community.",
